# Geometric-Liquidity-Dynamics (GLD)

**Geometric-Liquidity-Dynamics (GLD)** is a small, self-contained, deterministic financial simulator.  

It is **not intended for live trading**, but it is extremely valuable for:

- **Strategy Validation** – Test trading strategies in a reproducible environment.  
- **Quantitative Research** – Generate synthetic market data for modeling and experimentation.  
- **Risk Modeling** – Evaluate volatility, drawdowns, and other portfolio risk metrics.  
- **Educational Purposes** – Learn financial dynamics, stochastic processes, and simulation techniques.

Think of it as a **physics-informed Monte Carlo engine**:  
prices evolve according to momentum, mean-reversion, and stochastic noise, fully auditable and reproducible.
